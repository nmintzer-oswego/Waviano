### Example Workflows

#### Creating a Simple Recording
```
1. Type: 0          → Enter free play mode
2. Type: R1         → Start recording to slot 1
3. Play some notes  → Move hand to different distances
4. Type: S          → Stop recording
5. Type: P1         → Play back your recording
```

#### Creating a Multi-Track Composition
```
1. Type: R1         → Record bass line to slot 1
2. Play bass notes
3. Type: S          → Stop recording
4. Type: R2         → Record melody to slot 2
5. Play melody
6. Type: S          → Stop recording
7. Type: M1         → Set to "Priority High" mode
8. Type: PA         → Play both tracks merged!
```

#### Listing & Managing Recordings
```
Type: L             → View all recordings
Output:
  Slot 1: 15 notes, 4.5s
  Slot 2: 8 notes, 2.4s
  Slot 3: [Empty]
  Slot 4: [Empty]

Type: C2            → Clear slot 2
Type: L             → Verify it's cleared
```

### System Modes

The system operates in five distinct modes:

1. **MODE_MENU** - Idle, waiting for user input
2. **MODE_GUIDED** - Following a pre-programmed song
3. **MODE_FREE_PLAY** - Playing notes freely
4. **MODE_RECORDING** - Recording notes to a slot
5. **MODE_PLAYBACK** - Playing back recorded notes

### Memory Usage

- **Program Storage**: 14,024 bytes (43% of Arduino Uno's 32KB)
- **Dynamic Memory**: 1,832 bytes (89% of Arduino Uno's 2KB)
  - Recording slots: ~240 bytes (4 slots × 30 notes)
  - Playback timeline: ~720 bytes (120 events max)
  - Pre-programmed songs: ~200 bytes
  - State variables: ~672 bytes

### Recording System

Each recording slot stores:
- **Note index** (0-7): Which note was played
- **Duration** (0-255 units): How long the note lasted (100ms per unit)

Maximum capacity:
- **4 slots** total
- **30 notes** per slot
- **25.5 seconds** max duration per note
- **~75 seconds** total recording time (if distributed evenly)

### Multi-Track Playback Algorithm

1. **Collect Events**: Gather all note events from selected slots
2. **Sort by Time**: Sort events chronologically
3. **Resolve Overlaps**: Apply selected overlap strategy
4. **Play Timeline**: Execute merged timeline through buzzer

Since the Arduino has only one buzzer, true polyphony isn't possible. The overlap resolution strategies provide different artistic approaches to merging tracks.

## Configuration Options

Edit [config.h](config.h) to customize:

```cpp
// Recording capacity
#define NUM_RECORDING_SLOTS 4      // Number of recording slots
#define MAX_NOTES_PER_SLOT 30      // Notes per slot

// Timing
#define NOTE_DURATION_MS 500       // Free play note duration
#define NOTE_DEBOUNCE_MS 50        // Debounce time

// Overlap behavior
#define DEFAULT_OVERLAP_STRATEGY OVERLAP_PRIORITY_HIGH

// Debug output
#define ENABLE_DEBUG false         // Enable verbose logging
```

## Troubleshooting

### No sound from buzzer
- Check buzzer polarity (+ to Pin 2, - to GND)
- Verify buzzer is working (some buzzers need specific frequencies)
- Check Serial Monitor for debug output

### Sensor not detecting hand
- Ensure sensor is powered (VCC to 5V, GND to GND)
- Check TRIG connected to Pin 4, ECHO to Pin 3
- Sensor works best in range 2-80cm
- Avoid reflective or absorbent surfaces

### LEDs not lighting up
- Check resistors are 220Ω (Red-Red-Brown)
- Verify LED polarity (long leg = positive)
- Check pin connections (Pins 6-13)

### Recording not saving
- Memory might be full (check Serial output)
- Ensure you typed `S` to stop recording
- Maximum 30 notes per slot

### Playback sounds wrong
- Try different overlap modes (M1-M4)
- Verify recordings exist with `L` command
- Check that recordings aren't empty

## Advanced Customization

### Adding More Songs

Edit [songs.h](songs.h) to add new pre-programmed melodies:

```cpp
// Your new song
int melody_new_song[] = {
  LED_Do, LED_Re, LED_Mi, LED_Fa, LED_Sol
};
int length_new_song = sizeof(melody_new_song) / sizeof(melody_new_song[0]);
```

Then add to the `songs` array and update `NUM_SONGS`.

### Changing Note Frequencies

Edit [note_mapping.h](note_mapping.h) to use different frequencies or distance ranges:

```cpp
const int note_frequencies[NUM_NOTES] = {
  // Customize these frequencies
};

const DistanceRange distance_ranges[NUM_NOTES] = {
  // Adjust distance ranges
};
```

### Adding More Recording Slots

Edit [config.h](config.h):

```cpp
#define NUM_RECORDING_SLOTS 6  // Increase from 4 to 6
```

Note: Each slot uses ~60 bytes of RAM. Monitor memory usage!
